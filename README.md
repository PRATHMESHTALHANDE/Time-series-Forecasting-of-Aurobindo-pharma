# Time-series-Forecasting-of-Aurobindo-pharma
Me and my friends presented our first Time Series Forecasting on Aurobondo pharma . In this forecasting first we find out descriptive statistics. From that data we made interpretation on skewness and kurtosis. 
After that we made assumptions based on Jarque bera values. After that we estimated correlation and fitness , significance and robustness.
The correlation was for finding out relation between dependent and independent variables and coefficient. 
The data is tested with 1) Jarque Bera values 2) Correlogram 3) Augmented Fuller test (unit Root Test).
After that we tested error for 1) Jarque bera 2) Correlogram 3) Augmented Fuller (Unit Root test) 4) Bruch Godfray Lag Multiplier test (BG LM Test) 5) Darbin Watson (DW Test) to check trend, stationaryness , autocorrelation and normality which is to be whether explained or not explained by my regression model. 
This kind of model if significant then crusal assumptions can be taken from it.
